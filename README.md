#A storytale to Master the skills:

#Process 1 : 

#CLOTH and Handwritten Digits RECOGNITION

Classify the Clothes and Handwritten Digits with the help of Mnist Dataset with an API CALL FROM KERAS and measure its accuracy with the help of train and test datasets.

#Process 2:

#Improvise the MNIST DATASET with CONVOLUTION and MAX POOLING

Convoloution--The images are reshaped and the filters are applied on top of it
Max Pooling--The maximum pixel in the specified shape is taken out and the image is enhanced and compressed
