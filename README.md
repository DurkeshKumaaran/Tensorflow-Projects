# Tensorflow-Projects

#A storytale to Master the skills:

#Process 1 : 

#CLOTH and Handwritten Digits RECOGNITION

Classify the Clothes and Handwritten Digits with the help of Mnist Dataset with an API CALL FROM KERAS and measure its accuracy with the help of train and test datasets.

#Process 2:

#Improvise the MNIST DATASET with CONVOLUTION and MAX POOLING

Convoloution--The images are reshaped and the filters are applied on top of it
Max Pooling--The maximum pixel in the specified shape is taken out and the image is enhanced and compressed

#Process 3:
#Human or Horse Classifier

*The dataset is downloaded and extracted
*Tensorflow Sequential model is defined with 5 Convolution and Max Pooling layers
*Sigmoid Activation layer is used to improve accuracy for Binary classification with one output neuron and 512 hidden neurons for training purpose
*RMSprop optimizer  with a learning rate of 0.001 is defined with a binary cross entropy loss function
*Image Data Generator is imported from keras preprocessing image module and the images are rescaled and trained with 15 epochs
*Numpy is used to convert the image into a vertical stack array and the test image set is validated
